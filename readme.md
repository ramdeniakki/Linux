### Linux Commands

- **How to display the name of the current logged-in user?**
  ```
  whoami
  ```
  - **Description:** The `whoami` command outputs the username of the current user who is logged into the terminal session. It's useful for confirming your identity, especially if you're working with multiple user accounts.

- **How to display files and directories present in the current location?**
  ```
  ls
  ```
  - **Description:** The `ls` command lists the files and directories in the current working directory. By default, it shows only the names of the files and directories without additional details.

  ```
  ls -ltr
  ```
  - **Description:** The `ls -ltr` command lists the files and directories in the current location with detailed information. The flags mean:
    - `-l`: Use a long listing format, which includes details like permissions, number of links, owner, group, size, and modification date.
    - `-t`: Sort by modification time, with the newest files listed first.
    - `-r`: Reverse the order of the sort, so you see the oldest files first.

- **How to clear the Linux terminal?**
  ```
  clear
  ```
  - **Description:** The `clear` command clears all the text from the terminal screen, giving you a clean slate. It's especially useful when you want to declutter your workspace.

  ```
  ctrl + l
  ```
  - **Description:** This keyboard shortcut also clears the terminal screen. It's a quick way to achieve the same result as the `clear` command without typing it out.
